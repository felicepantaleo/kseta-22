The CUDA Runtime API reference manual is a very useful source of information:
<a href="http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-runtime-api/index.html" target="_blank">http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-runtime-api/index.html</a>

```bash
$ cd kseta-22/hands-on/cuda-exercises
```


Check that your environment is correctly configured to compile CUDA code by running:
```bash
$ nvcc --version
```

Compile and run the `deviceQuery` application:
```bash
cd kseta-22/hands-on/cuda-exercises/utils/deviceQuery
make
```

You can get some useful information about the features and the limits that you will find on the device you will be running your code on. For example:
```
$ ./deviceQuery 
./deviceQuery Starting...

Some of you are sharing the same machine and some time measurements can be influenced by other users running at the very same moment. It can be necessary to run time measurements multiple times.


### Exercise 1. CUDA Memory Model
In this exercise you will learn what heterogeneous memory model means, by demonstrating the difference between host and device memory spaces.

1. Allocate device memory;
2. Copy the host array h_a to d_a on the device;
3. Copy the device array d_a to the device array d_b;
4. Copy the device array d_b to the host array h_a;
5. Free the memory allocated for d_a and d_b.
6. Compile and run the program by running:

```bash
$ nvcc cuda_mem_model.cu -o ex01
$ ./ex01
```

* Bonus: Measure the PCI Express bandwidth.

### Exercise 2. Launch a kernel
By completing this exercise you will learn how to configure and launch a simple CUDA kernel.

1. Allocate device memory;
2. Configure the kernel to run using a one-dimensional grid of one-dimensional blocks;
3. Each GPU thread should set one element of the array to:

   `d_a[i] = blockIdx.x + threadIdx.x + 42;`
4. Copy the results to the host memory;
5. Check the correctness of the results

### Exercise 3. Two-dimensional grid
M is a matrix of NxN integers.

1. Set N=4
2. Write a kernel that sets each element of the matrix to its linear index (e.g. M[2,3] = 2*N + 3), by making use of two-dimensional grid and blocks. (Two-dimensional means using the x and y coordinates).
3. Copy the result to the host and check that it is correct.
4. Try with a rectangular matrix 19x67. Hint: check the kernel launch parameters.


### Exercise 4. Measuring throughput
The throughput of a kernel can be defined as the number of bytes read and written by a kernel in the unit of time.

The CUDA event API includes calls to create and destroy events, record events, and compute the elapsed time in milliseconds between two recorded events.

CUDA events make use of the concept of CUDA streams. A CUDA stream is simply a sequence of operations that are performed in order on the device. Operations in different streams can be interleaved and in some cases overlapped, a property that can be used to hide data transfers between the host and the device. Up to now, all operations on the GPU have occurred in the default stream, or stream 0 (also called the "Null Stream").

The peak theoretical throughput can be evaluated as well: if your device comes with a memory clock rate of 1GHz DDR (double data rate) and a 256-bit wide memory interface, the peak theoretical throughput can be computed with the following:

Throughput (GB/s)= Memory_rate(Hz) * memory_interface_width(byte) * 2 /10<sup>9</sup>

1. Compute the theoretical peak throughput of the device you are using.
2. Modify ex04.cu to give the measurement of actual throughput of the kernel.
3. Measure the throughput with a varying number of elements (in logarithmic scale). Before doing that write down what do you expect (you can also draw a diagram).
4. What did you find out? Can you give an explanation?


### Exercise 5. Parallel Reduction
Given an array `a[N]`, the reduction sum `Sum` of a is the sum of all its elements: `Sum=a[0]+a[1]+...a[N-1]`.
1. Implement a block-wise parallel reduction (using the shared memory).
2. For each block, save the partial sum.
3. Sum all the partial sums together.
4. Check the result comparing with the host result.
5. Measure the throughput of your reduction kernel using CUDA Events (see exercise 4)
6. Analyze your application using `nvvp`. Do you think it can be improved? How?
* Bonus: Can you implement a one-step reduction? Measure and compare the throughput of the two versions.
* Challenge: The cumulative sum of an array `a[N]` is another array `b[N]`, the sum of prefixes of `a`:
`b[i] = a[0] + a[1] + … + a[i]`. Implement a cumulative sum kernel assuming that the size of the input array is multiple of the block size.

### Challenge: Histogram

The purpose of this lab is to implement an efficient histogramming algorithm for an input array of integers within a given range.

Each integer will map into a single bin, so the values will range from 0 to (NUM_BINS - 1).

The histogram bins will use unsigned 32-bit counters that must be saturated at 127 (i.e. no roll back to 0 allowed).

The input length can be assumed to be less than 2ˆ32. `NUM_BINS` is fixed at 4096 for this lab.
This can be split into two kernels: one that does a histogram without saturation, and a final kernel that cleans up the bins if they are too large. These two stages can also be combined into a single kernel.

### Utility. Measuring time using CUDA Events
```C++
cudaEvent_t start, stop; float time;
cudaEventCreate(&start);  cudaEventCreate(&stop);
cudaEventRecord(start, 0);
square_array <<< n_blocks, block_size >>> (a_d, N);
cudaEventRecord(stop, 0);
cudaEventSynchronize(stop);
cudaEventElapsedTime(&time, start, stop);
std::cout << "Time for the kernel: " << time << " ms" << std::endl;
```



### Atomics <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#atomic-functions" target="_blank">[1]</a>

An atomic function performs a read-modify-write atomic operation on one 32-bit or 64-bit word residing in global or shared memory.
The operation is atomic in the sense that it is guaranteed to be performed without interference from other threads.


```C++
int atomicAdd(int* address, int val);
unsigned int atomicAdd(unsigned int* address,
                       unsigned int val);
unsigned long long int atomicAdd(unsigned long long int* address,
                                 unsigned long long int val);
float atomicAdd(float* address, float val);
double atomicAdd(double* address, double val);
__half2 atomicAdd(__half2 *address, __half2 val);
__half atomicAdd(__half *address, __half val);
```

reads the 16-bit, 32-bit or 64-bit word old located at the address address in global or shared memory, computes (old + val), and stores the result back to memory at the same address. These three operations are performed in one atomic transaction. The function returns old.
